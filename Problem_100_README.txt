<b>Intuition</b>
The problem is asking us to determine if two binary trees are identical in structure (number of nodes) and have the same values at corresponding nodes. We leverage a level-by-level comparison using breadth-first search (BFS) here. Start with the root nodes of both trees and compare their values. Then work through the trees' children nodes one level at a time and compare the two trees to each other level by level.

<b>Approach</b>
Check if both trees are empty (null). If they are then return true because two empty trees are considered the same.
If one tree is empty while the other is not, or their values at the root nodes differ, return false.
Create a queue and enqueue the root nodes of both trees.
Begin the BFS:
Dequeue two nodes at a time from the queue (one from each tree).
If both nodes are null, continue to the next pair of nodes.
If their values differ then return false.
Enqueue the left and right children of both nodes.
Repeat the process until the queue is empty.
If no differences are found during the traversal, return true, meaning that the trees are the same.

<b>Complexity</b>
Time complexity:
O(n) where n is the total number of nodes in the binary trees. We visit each node once during BFS.

Space complexity:
O(n), as the space required for the queue can grow to hold all nodes in both trees in the worst case.
